# **Fall**

A deadly genetic virus has infected humanity.

1. We are natural born sinners ({% include bref.html b='Romans' c="5" v="12,17" %}). "Original sin" is understood as the effect which the sin of Adam has upon us as a precondition of our lives. (_Christian Theology_, Erickson, Millard, Baker Book House, 1987, page 631) By representative headship Adam's corruption and guild is imputed to us.
2. We are sinners who sin in mind ({% include bref.html b="Jeremiah" c="17" v="8-9" %}), and will ( {% include bref.html b="Romans" c="1" v="32" %}), violating God's law ({% include bref.html b="Romans" c="3" v="19"%}), and personal consience ({% include bref.html b="Romans" c="2" v="15" %}).
3. We are spiritually depraved and unable to self correct (
{%include bref.html b="Romans" c="5" v="6" %},
{%include bref.html b="Ephesians" c="2" v="1-8" %},
{%include bref.html b="Titus" c="3" v="5" %}).
