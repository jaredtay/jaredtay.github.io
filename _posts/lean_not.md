     Proverbs 3:5,6
     
     Trust in the LORD with all your heart,
     and do not rely on your own understanding.
     
     Acknowledge Him in all your ways,
     and He will make your paths straight.

Contrary to popular belief, I am a fool. I suppose I can't say what is popular belief, polite society usually keeps those types of opinions to themselves. But I assure you, I am a fool. But I am thankful that there is someone smarter than I that has my back if I go to Him. If I look to him, He will guide.
