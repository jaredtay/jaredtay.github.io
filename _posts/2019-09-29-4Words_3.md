"For waht is more consonant with faith than to recognize that we are naked of all virtue, in order to be clothed by God? That we are empty of all good, to be filled by him? That we are slaves of sin, to be freed by him? Blind, to be illuminated by him? Lame, to be made straight by him? Weak to be sustained by him? To take away from us all occasion for glorying, that he alone may stand forth gloriously and we glory in him [cf. {% include bref.html b='1 Corinthians' c='1' v=31 %}; {%include bref.html b='2 Corinthians' c='10' v='17' %}]?" John Calvin, Institutes of the Christian Religion.
