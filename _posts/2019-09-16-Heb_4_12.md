For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing sould from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart. And no creature is hidden from God, but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of Him to whom we must render an account.
