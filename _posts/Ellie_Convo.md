My girl Elena has a wonderful capacity for thinking about sad things. She was playing with a piece of ethernet cable. She asked me if the electricity was on. I told her no, there was no electricity in the cable. She said 

That is good, I would kill myself if there was electricity in it. Then you would be sad. Then there would only be three of you. No wait, there would be four because you have baby Joshua. You could spend time with your little boy.

I would still miss my little girl.

Yeah, you would be sad. But then I would be in heaven and I could see my sister.

Yeah, Maxi Raye, you could meet her. 

Maxi? I don't like that name.

You could call her Raye, is that better?

Yeah, that would be funny.
