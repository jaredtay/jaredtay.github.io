The tongue weight is the amount of weight that is pushing on the trailer hitch of your truck. Anyone who knows how to haul something knows how to orient the load so the bulk of the weight is over the axel of the trailer, not the hitch. This is all well and good, but how do you know what the tongue weight of a load is?
